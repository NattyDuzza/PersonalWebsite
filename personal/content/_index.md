# About Me

Hi, I'm Nathan. I am currently studying a MathPhys degree at the University
of Warwick. 

I plan to use this website to document my interests. This will mainly be academicly oriented, but I post about my other hobbies as well. 

Cosmology is my current area of most interest and I am pursuing modules that will help further my knowledge of this area of Physics. I am also undertaking a research project in LSS Cosmology at the University of Oxford during this summer (2025). I will post updates on this here.

Outside of academia my interests include:

- Motorsport (F1, British Superbikes, Sim-racing)
- Radio Controlled Aircraft
- Classical Theatre
- Writing (Both fiction and non-fiction)
